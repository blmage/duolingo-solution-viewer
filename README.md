### Download

* [**Chrome** extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duolingo-solution-viewer/idffaipgnlkhfhibgnodeiogpgojcmfm)
* [**Firefox** add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/duolingo-solution-viewer/)
* [**Opera** addon](https://addons.opera.com/fr/extensions/details/duolingo-solution-viewer/)

### Features

* Provides a link to the list of solutions of the current challenge, once you have submitted your answer:

  <img src="https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-solution-viewer/blob/assets_v4/screenshots/base_correct_answer_solution_list_link.png" width="500" />

    * By default, the solutions are sorted by their similarity with your answer:

      <img src="https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-solution-viewer/blob/assets_v4/screenshots/base_correct_answer_solution_list_modal.png" width="500" />

    * But you can also switch to an alphabetical sort:

      <img src="https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-solution-viewer/blob/assets_v4/screenshots/base_correct_answer_solution_list_modal_alphabetical_sort.png" width="500" />

    * Click on your answer to edit it. The similarity scores of the solutions will be refreshed accordingly:

      <img src="https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-solution-viewer/blob/assets_v4/screenshots/base_correct_answer_solution_list_modal_reference_update.png" width="500" />

      <img src="https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-solution-viewer/blob/assets_v4/screenshots/base_correct_answer_solution_list_modal_update_result.png" width="500" />

    * Click on the thumbtack button to pin your reference answer, and easily compare it with all the solutions:

      <img src="https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-solution-viewer/blob/assets_v4/screenshots/base_correct_answer_solution_list_modal_pinned_answer.png" width="500" />

    * Filter the solutions by entering one or more words in the filter input (click on the icons on the left of a filter to refine it):

      <img src="https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-solution-viewer/blob/assets_v4/screenshots/base_correct_answer_solution_list_modal_filter.png" width="500" />

    * Select a word (or just a part of it) in any solution to quickly add a new filter:

      <img src="https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-solution-viewer/blob/assets_v4/screenshots/base_correct_answer_solution_list_modal_filter_selection.png" width="500" />

* Remembers the lists of solutions of each challenge, to also make them available from the corresponding forum discussions:

    <img src="https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-solution-viewer/blob/assets_v4/screenshots/base_forum_solution_list.png" width="500" />

* Displays the closest solution when the answer you submitted is incorrect:

  <img src="https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-solution-viewer/blob/assets_v4/screenshots/base_incorrect_answer_closest_solution.png" width="500" />

* Outlines typos in answers to listening challenges:

<img src="https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-solution-viewer/blob/assets_v4/screenshots/base_correct_answer_listening_correction.png" width="500" />

* Strives to blend seamlessly in [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com)'s UI, and to be compatible with custom themes such as [Darklingo++](https://userstyles.org/styles/169205/darklingo):

### Keyboard shortcuts

After having submitted an answer to a challenge, use:
* `s` to open the solution window, and `Esc` to close it,
* `r` to open the report window,
* `d` to open the forum discussion in a new tab.

When a list of solutions is available, use:
* `f` to focus the filter input, and `Esc` to leave it,
* `↑` / `↓` to scroll up / down the list,
* `←` / `→` to navigate through the pages one by one,
* `Ctrl` + `←` / `→` to go directly to the first / last page.

When the filter input is focused:
* enter a word, then use `Enter` to add a filter (see the [filter shortcuts](#filter-shortcuts) below),
* use `Backspace` to remove the last added filter,
* .. and suggestions are available:
  * use `↑` / `↓` to select a suggestion,
  * use `Enter` to add a filter based on the selected suggestion (shortcuts will be preserved).
 
### Filter shortcuts

For most languages, enter:
* " **word** " for solutions that include the exact word,
* " __*__&#8202;example " for solutions that include a word ending with "*example*",
* " example&#8202;__*__ " for solutions that include a word beginning with "*example*",
* " __*__&#8202;example&#8202;__*__ " for solutions that include a word containing "*example*",
* " __-__&#8202;word " for solutions that **do not** include the exact word (wildcard variants above are also available).

For languages that do not use space-separated words (such as Japanese), enter:
* " **word** " for solutions that include the word anywhere,
* " __*__&#8202;example " for solutions ending with "*example*",
* " example&#8202;__*__ " for solutions beginning with "*example*",
* "  __=__&#8202;example " for exact solutions,
* "  __-__&#8202;word " for solutions that **do not** include the word (again, all variants above are available).

### Limitations

* The extension is deeply tied to how the UI components are "named", meaning that significant changes on
  [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com)'s side could (temporarily) break it. If that happens, you can either:
    * wait for me to fix it,
    * try to fix it yourself, then open a related [PR](https://github.com/blmage/duolingo-solution-viewer/compare).

* The lists of solutions are built by flattening the original solution graphs, which are not optimized against
  redundancies (_they actually don't need to be_). This can lead to lists of solutions containing lots of very similar
  sentences.

* "Fill in the blank" challenges are based on "normal" translation challenges. The lists of solutions provided for them
  may  therefore include sentences that do not match the blanks.

### Translations

The extension falls back to _English_ when translations for the current UI language are not available.

The currently supported languages are:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><strong>Language</strong></td>
      <td align="center"><strong>Thanks to</strong></td>
    </tr>
